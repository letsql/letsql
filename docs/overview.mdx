## Overview

**xorq** is a Python-based machine learning processing tool designed to
simplify and accelerate your ML workflows. xorq brings together diverse data
engines like DuckDB, DataFusion, and Snowflake under one unified interface.

Whether you're a data scientist or ML engineer, xorq empowers you to focus on
innovation rather than infrastructure.

### Features

- **Expr (Ibis-Powered):** Define transformations using a familiar, Pythonic
  API that is both expressive and backend-agnostic.
- **Cache:** Avoid redundant computations by materializing intermediate results
  as Arrow RecordBatches, ensuring minimal re-computation.
- **Portable Python UDFs:** Write and serve Python UDFs seamlessly –
  whether they’re used for aggregation, windowing, or transformation tasks.

> **Mission Statement:**  
> “Make data processing ergonomic, performant and reproducible.”
