LETSQL

Data processing library built on top of **Ibis** and **DataFusion** to write multi-engine data workflows.

Key Features:

- Simplicity: LETSQL leverages the Ibis expression system to offer a familiar dataframe experience
- Versatile: Use it for interactive rapid exploration, or to maintain complex ELT/ETL jobs, via DataFrame or SQL
- Speed: Provided by the usage of DataFusion a fast, embeddable, and extensible query engine written in Rust
- In-situ analysis: Natively query data in Postgres, Snowflake, BigQuery, or in any of the 20+ Ibis backends
- Query Federation: Access data from multiple systems within a single expression on a DataFrame.
- Open: Built on top of Ibis and DataFusion two independently governed open-source projects
