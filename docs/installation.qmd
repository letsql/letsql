# Installation

First, obtain at least Python 3.10 and make sure you have [created and activated](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) a virtual environment.
Using a virtual environment is strongly recommended, since it will help you to avoid clutter in your system-wide libraries. Once the requirements are met, you can use pip:

```bash
pip install letsql
```

If the installation worked correctly, you should see the following after executing:

```{python}
import letsql
letsql.__version__
```
