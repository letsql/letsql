## Contributing Guide

### Setting up a development environment

This assumes that you have rust and cargo installed. We use the workflow recommended by [pyo3](https://github.com/PyO3/pyo3) and [maturin](https://github.com/PyO3/maturin).

#### Using pip and venv

```bash
# fetch this repo
git clone git@github.com:letsql/letsql.git
# prepare development environment (used to build wheel / install in development)
python3 -m venv venv
# activate the venv
source venv/bin/activate
# update pip itself if necessary
python -m pip install -U pip
# install dependencies 
python -m pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
# set up the git hook scripts
pre-commit install
```

### Running the test suite
Install the [just](https://github.com/casey/just#installation) command runner, if needed.
Download example data to run the tests successfully.

```bash
just download-data
```

To test the code:
```bash
# make sure you activate the venv using "source venv/bin/activate" first
maturin develop
just up postgres # some of the tests use postgres
python -m pytest # or pytest
```

### Writing the commit

LETSQL follows the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) structure.
In brief, the commit summary should look like:

    fix(types): make all floats doubles

The type (e.g. `fix`) can be:

- `fix`: A bug fix. Correlates with PATCH in SemVer
- `feat`: A new feature. Correlates with MINOR in SemVer
- `docs`: Documentation only changes
- `style`: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)

If the commit fixes a GitHub issue, add something like this to the bottom of the description:

    fixes #4242


### Release Flow
***This section is intended for LETSQL maintainers***

#### Steps
1. Compute the new version number (`<version-number>`) according to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) rules
2. Update the version number in Cargo.toml
3. Tag the last commit in main with `<version-number>`
4. Update the CHANGELOG using `git cliff`, manually add any additional notes (links to blogposts, etc.)
5. Create commit with message `release: <version-number>`
6. Push and manually trigger the workflow
