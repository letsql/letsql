Data processing library built on top of **Ibis** and **DataFusion** to write efficient multi-engine data workflows.

> [!CAUTION]
> This library does not currently have a stable release. Both the API and implementation are subject to change, and future updates may not be backward compatible.

## Getting Started

### Installation

LETSQL is available as [`letsql`](https://pypi.org/project/letsql/) on PyPI:

```shell
pip install letsql
```

### Usage

```python
import urllib.request

import letsql as ls

urllib.request.urlretrieve("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data/master/iris.csv", "iris.csv")

con = ls.connect()
iris_table = con.read_csv("iris.csv", table_name="iris")

res = (
    iris_table.filter([iris_table.sepal_length > 5])
    .group_by("species")
    .agg(iris_table.sepal_width.sum())
    .execute()
)
```

for more examples on how to use letsql, check the [examples](https://github.com/letsql/letsql/tree/main/examples) directory, 
note that in order to run some of the scripts in there, you need to install the library with `examples` extra:

```shell
pip install 'letsql[examples]'
```
